/**
 * <p>
 * <b>OVERVIEW</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The calculator supports two different interest rates for different parts of the credit card charges - cash
 * withdrawals and purchases.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The calculator supports an optional interest free period for purchases.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * The function 'calculate()' computes effective annual percentage rate (EAPR) under two assumptions:
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * a) According to a regulation issued by the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman:<br>
 * <a href="http://www.forbrukerombudet.no/asset/4757/1/4757_1.pdf">http://www.forbrukerombudet.no/asset/4757/1/4757_1.pdf</a>
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <p>
 * Here, all charges are assumed made the first day and paid back in 12 monthly annuities. An eventual interest free
 * period or other advantages (cash back) should not be taken into account.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * In marketing, the banks should present an EAPR computet as the effective interest rate resulting from a loan of
 * 15.000 NOK. This should consist of 10 purchases in Norway, 3 purchases outside Norway, 1 cash withdrawal in Norway
 * and 1 cash withdrawal outside Norway, each of 1.000 NOK. All made the first day the customer has the card.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Although the user can choose other sums and usage pattern in the calculator, the computation method is still regarded
 * as binding, and the calculator always returns this "government rate" as one of the results.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The total payment is not covered by the regulation. The payment sums could thus be computed under more realistic
 * conditions.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * (The Norwegian regulation is an application of a EU directive:<br>
 * <a href="http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:133:0066:0092:EN:PDF">
 *  http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:L:2008:133:0066:0092:EN:PDF
 * </a>)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * b) As above, but with a more realistic payback stream.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * freeCard 1.0 also computes the effective interest rate when the interest-free period is taken into account and where
 * the normally delayed payment (15 - 20 days after the end of the month) is considered.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * But even this more "realistic" method assumes that all charges are made the first day. So it is not completely
 * realistic. One could envisage a future version where the usage was assumed spread out in time; charges made evenly or
 * stocastically.
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * <b>NOT IN THIS VERSION</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There are two variables currently harvested in the Datafanger that we don't use here:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Renteberegning varekj√∏p ved kreditt Fakturadato/uttaksdato (rate computation when purchasing - on billday/on purchase
 * day) Renteberegning uttak ved kreditt Fakturadato/uttaksdato (rat computation when withdrawing cash - on bill day/on
 * withdrawal day)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Whatever time the interest runs from, will not override the Consumer Ombudsman's model. Furthermore, when there is an
 * interest free period for purchases, interest will not be computed until the end of this period anyway.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Finally, I don't think interest computation from bill day could ever pertain to cash withdrawals. It is dificult to
 * imagine that the banks would "give away" free interest days for cash (for purchases, the shops pay for the interest
 * free days).
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The calculator handles only monthly payments and only annuity loans in arrears (annuity-immediate, or ordinaray
 * annuities).
 * </p>
 * 
 * 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * <b>SECTIONS</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>Preparation and adaption of data</li>
 * <li>The annuities</li>
 * <li>Effective interest rate</li>
 * <li>Result reporting</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * <b>THE PLAN: THREE ANNUITY SERIES</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * The interest rate is computed by iterations. Before performing the iterations, we need to know each monthly payment.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Hence, all the relevant Payments, number of periods and remainders are first computed.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * There might be different interest rates for cash withdrawals and purchases. In the case of interest free days, they
 * usually only pertain to purchases, not to cash withdrawals. The two streams might have to be treated differently.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Moreover, there are annual fees not fitting into the model with monthly annuities.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * We thus make three annuitiy series:
 * </p>
 * 
 * <ol>
 * <li>The annuities paid back to the card company for cash withdrawal</li>
 * <li>The annuities paid back to the card company for purchases</li>
 * <li>The annuity series consisting of annual fees</li>
 * </ol>
 * 
 * <p>
 * As there is often an interest free period for purchases, but not for cash withdrawals, this model also allows us to
 * compute a more realistic interest rate computation, in addition to the model given in the public regulation.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * (In a perfect world, we should be able to randomly spread out the purchases and withdrawal along the time line, for
 * again to achieve a more realistic picture of the usage pattern. This last wish is incomaptible with annuities, of
 * course. A feature with evenly spread charges to the card would, however be relatively easy to compute. But not in
 * this version.)
 * </p>
 * 
 * <br>
 * <br>
 * <p>
 * <b>ERRORS:</b>
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * When the computed payment is smaller than the minimum payment required in the parameters 'minpayPerc' and
 * 'minpayPayment', the loan must be paid back faster than the user has requested. It is less confusing to ask the user
 * to select a shorter payback period than to first compute the minimum payback time and then compute the effective
 * interest rate. Hence, in these cases an {@link FreeLoanException} is thrown.

         * 
         * 
         * 
         * 
         * THE "ADVANCED" FORMULA
         * 
         * Most credit cards don't charge interest for purchases before after 45 / 50 days, while cash withdrawals are
         * charged with interest from the first day.
         * 
         * The "government formula" does not take this into consideration, as it is adapted to a public regulations
         * deciding how effective interest on credit cards should be computed: Every charge to the card - purchases and
         * withdrawals are assumed to be made the first day. Thereafter, the card is not charged more and the debt is
         * paid back in monthly annuities in arrears at the end of each month.
         * 
         * The guide states that an eventual interest free period should be ignored in this computation.
         * 
         * But the user might still want to see a more realistic computation. We can take the interest free period into
         * account by treating the payback stream from the purchases differently: We apply the present value formula for
         * annuities due - the first installment being paid at once, in time zero, at the very start of the time line.
         * This will emulate that there is no interest before the payment takes place. These annuities should be the
         * ones actually paid.
         * 
         * We compute the sommon annuity for the other elements, the payments pertaing to cash withdrawals and fees,
         * "normally", treating these as annuities in arrears.
         * 
         * I might be necessary to augment this latter payment stream further, by the time from the bill is issued until
         * the due date. The annuity in arrears already takes 30 interest rate bearing days into consideration, but
         * there might be 15/20 more.
         * 
         * (These additional days will be computed with the nominal interest rate computed by the 'bank-method': The
         * arithmetic average of the interest rate. By this method, when the monthly interest rate is 1%, the rate for
         * half a month is simply 1/2%. This is not mathematically correct, but it is the way the banks normally do it,
         * so we must emulate that here in order to obtain the actual payments.)
         * 
         * There are not two payment streams, only one. Both the interest-bearing cash withdrawals and the temporarily
         * interest free purchases are served with the same monthly payback stream, starting after 45 / 50 days.
         * 
         * Hence, we sum the payments, getting one payment stream and finding the present value of this.
         * 
         * But the normal present value in arrears formula stipulates that our observation point lays one month before
         * the first payment.
         * 
         * We, thus, have to further discount the payment stream with the 15/20 days longer, first period.
         * 
         * We have already computed the annuity for purchases, using the normal annuity formula with annuities in
         * arrears. Now, we recompute it with the annuities in advance-formula:
         * 
         * 
         * annuPurch = loanPurchase * (1 - kp) / (1 - Math.pow(kp,numberOfMonths)); // Applying the formula for
         * annuities in advance
         * 
         * annuOther = sumannuity - purchaseAnnuity; // Subtracting the old "purchase annuity", computed above,
         * stipulating annuities in arrears
         * 
         * annu = annuPurch + annuOther;
         * 
         * 
         * We are searching for an annual, effective interest rate. But since the payments are monthly, it is practical
         * to first find the monthly interest rate, 'r', which is a desimal number (0,015 means 1,5%). Each monthly
         * amount should be multiplied with 1,015 (1 + r) to obtain the next.
         * 
         * If something grows by 1,5% each month, how much does it grow by in one day?
         * 
         * If we assume daily capitalization:
         * 
         * (1 + rd) = (1 + r) ^ (1/30) // The daily growth rate is the 30th root of the monthly growth rate
         * 
         * Discouting means dividing by the growth factor, or multiplying by 1 / (1 + r). We call this factor k:
         * 
         * 
         * As k = 1 / (1 + r) => (1 + r) = 1/k // The monthly growth factor
         * 
         * (1 + r)^(1/30) = (1/k)^(1/30) // The daily growth factor
         * 
         * 
         * We now have the annuity stream. We first find the preliminary present value as such:
         * 
         * pvP = annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)
         * 
         * With its monthly scope, this is the present value one month ahead of the first payment.
         * 
         * But the payment stream in reality starts later.
         * 
         * extraDays = dueDays - 30 // The number of days we shall discount the computed present value by
         * 
         * We will first compute the growth factor for the extra days. It is the daily growth factor, '(1/k)^(1/30)',
         * raised by the number of extra days:
         * 
         * extraGrowth = ((1/k)^(1/30))^extraDays
         * 
         * I follows as normal computation rules that (a^m)^n = a^(m * n), Thus..
         * 
         * extraGrowth = (1/k)^(1/30 * extraDays) = (1/k)^(extraDays/30)
         * 
         * The discount rate is the inverse of the growth rate: 1/ (1 + r) = k
         * 
         * Hence, we make a new discount rate, ke, for the 'extraDays' number of days:
         * 
         * ke = 1 / ((1/k)^(extraDays/30))
         * 
         * Or, in Javascript:
         * 
         * ke = 1 / Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30)
         * 
         * 
         * We still maintain the assumption that all charges to the card are made the first day. Thus, the present value
         * equals the nominal, received sum.
         * 
         * The annuity formula gives us the payment stream that starts 30 days after we get the card. But the due date
         * is slightly later, normally 15-20 days into the next month. The bank will charge interest up to payment day,
         * so we must discount the preliminary present value we found, 'pvP', with these extra days to obtain the
         * present value.
         * 
         * received = pvP * ke // Discounted with the extra days. We substitute pvP with its formula:
         * 
         * received = (annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)) * ke // We substitute 'ke' by 'ke = 1 /
         * Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30)', as derived above:
         * 
         * received = (annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)) * 1 / Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30)
         * 
         * => (annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)) / Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30) - received = 0;
         * 
         * y = (annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)) / Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30) - received; //
         * Assuming a continous function
         * 
         * In order to use Newton's method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_method), we must also find the
         * derived of the function - y'
         * 
         * This is of course great fun, as we have a function with another function as one of its variables.
         * 
         * We'll proceed stepwise, by breaking up y in its parts and treat the parts separately. First in its two main
         * derivable factors:
         * 
         * y = (annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)) / Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30) - received;
         * 
         * a = annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)
         * 
         * b = Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30)
         * 
         * When we have found the derivatives of a and b, we can apply the product rule:
         * 
         * y' = (a'*b - a * b') / b^2
         * 
         * First a
         * 
         * a = annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) / (1 - k)
         * 
         * a consists of functions both in its nominator and denominator. We treat these separartely too:
         * 
         * aNo = annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1))
         * 
         * aDe = (1 - k)
         * 
         * We are looking to apply the quotient rule:
         * 
         * a' = (aNo' * aDe - aNo * aDe') / aDe ^2
         * 
         * First the derivatives:
         * 
         * aNo = annu * (k - Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1))
         * 
         * aNo' = annu * (1 - (numberOfMonths+1) * Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths))
         * 
         * aDe = (1-k)
         * 
         * aDe' = -1
         * 
         * a' = ((annu * (1 - (numberOfMonths+1) * Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths))) * (1-k) - annu * (k -
         * Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1)) * -1) / Math.pow(1 - k, 2)
         * 
         * a' = ((annu * (1 - (numberOfMonths+1) * Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths))) * (1-k) + annu * (k -
         * Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths+1))) / Math.pow(1 - k, 2)
         * 
         * (For convenience, we have already computed 'numberOfMonths + 1' above, in the variable 'plusmonth'
         * 
         * Then b:
         * 
         * b = Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30)
         *

         * (extraDays/30 * Math.pow(1/k,(extraDays/30)-1)/Math.pow(k,2))) / Math.pow(Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30))^2
         * 
         * The term 'Math.pow(Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30))^2' can be transformed to 'Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/30 * 2) =
         * Math.pow(1/k,extraDays/15)'. Hence..
         * 
         * y' = ((annu * (1 - plusmonth * Math.pow(k,numberOfMonths))) * (1-k) + annu * (k - Math.pow(k,plusmonth))) /
